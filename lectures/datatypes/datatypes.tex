\maketitle
We introduce the fundamental notions of types, pattern matching, and recursion.
A number of examples show how to model a problem as a type, and demonstrate that type definitions help us toward a solution.

\subsection*{Types}
A type is the range of significance of a variable. -Russell
Everything has a type.

\subsection*{Matching}
Pattern-matching lets us case analyze a value.

\subsection*{Recursion}
Recursive functions are defined in terms of themselves.
Break problems into subproblems until we hit a base.

\subsection*{Examples}
First step in solving a proble is designing a type.

\subsubsection*{Numbers}
\coffeebreak{What is the essence of numbers?}

\subsubsection*{Strings}
Characters are an enum.
Strings are sequences.

\subsubsection*{Booleans}
Extremely easy after doing characters.
Should probably be an exercise.

\subsubsection*{Dependent Something}
idk
